# Welcome to Text Penguin!

Text Penguin is a webapp where users can upload documents (by either copying it into a text box or uploading a .txt file) in order to have the contents of the document analyzed by three different algorithms:
Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency, Part-of-Speech Tagging, and Latent Direchlet Allocation.

## Why should I use Text Penguin?

Text Penguin currently provides you access to three of the most commonly used text analysis algorithms and if you sign up for a <b>free</b> account, we give you a place to save your analyzed documents.
The documents can be saved in files called "Projects", which will act as a means to organize the documents for a single project if need be.
