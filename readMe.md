# Text Penguin

This program is an SPA where the user can upload a document that is a .pdf or .docx in order to have the contents of the document analyzed by three different algorithms:
Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency, Sentiment Analysis, and Latent Direchlet Allocation. The documents can be saved in files called "Projects", which will act as a means to organize the documents for a single project if need be.
The projects can be accessed later by the user as long as they have created a login.
